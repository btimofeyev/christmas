        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>In Plain English:</strong> We take your privacy seriously. We don't store your photos (they're deleted immediately after processing), we only collect your email if you choose to unlock unlimited generations, and we use Google Gemini AI to process your images. That's it.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to HomeDesign AI ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application HomeDesign AI — Holiday Edition (the "App").</p>

        <p><strong>Data retention:</strong> <strong>We do NOT store your photos.</strong> Images are processed in real-time and immediately deleted after the decorated version is generated and returned to you.

        <h3>2.4 Camera and Photo Library Access</h3>
